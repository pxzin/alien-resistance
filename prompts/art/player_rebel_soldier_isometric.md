# Prompt: Player - Rebel Soldier (Isometric Sprite)

**GDD Reference:** Section 2.4.1. Soldier Archetypes

This file contains a refined prompt specifically for generating the **isometric gameplay sprite** for a rebel soldier.

---

### Main Prompt (v2):

```
2d game sprite, a rebel soldier, isometric 3/4 perspective, for a tactical RPG, pixel art style similar to Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, wearing worn-out tactical gear and a gas mask, holding a rifle, high contrast, on a transparent background
```

### Negative Prompt (v2):

```
side view, side-scrolling, profile view, 3d, cartoon, cute, friendly, photo, realistic, low-resolution, blurry, text, watermark
```

---

### Rationale:

-   This version removes the conflicting 'Darkest Dungeon' reference, which is strongly associated with a side-scrolling view.
-   It adds more explicit isometric keywords like 'isometric 3/4 perspective' and 'for a tactical RPG'.
-   It replaces the conflicting reference with 'Tactics Ogre' to reinforce the desired camera angle and style.
