# Prompt: Player - Common Person (Static Sprite)

**GDD Reference:** Section 5.1. Premise and Starting Point

This file contains a prompt for generating a single, static "key art" sprite for the initial player character. This approach prioritizes quality and consistency for a single frame, which can be used as a placeholder in-game and as a reference for future animation.

### Main Prompt (for Midjourney):

```
a single 2d game sprite of a common person survivor, isometric 3/4 perspective, standing idle, wearing simple worn-out jeans and a jacket, holding a small pistol, detailed pixel art style of Final Fantasy Tactics, dark and gritty atmosphere, on a transparent background --style raw
```

### Negative Prompt:

```
multiple characters, spritesheet, grid, 3d, photo, realistic, blurry, text, watermark
```

---

### Rationale:

-   **`a single 2d game sprite`**: Explicitly asks for only one image, avoiding the inconsistent spritesheet format.
-   **`standing idle`**: Defines a clear, simple pose for the character.
-   **`Final Fantasy Tactics`**: Provides a strong, single reference for the isometric pixel art style.
-   **`multiple characters, spritesheet, grid`**: Added to the negative prompt to further discourage the AI from attempting a sheet format.
