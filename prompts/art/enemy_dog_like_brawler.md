-   **`pixel art style, detailed character design similar to Final Fantasy Tactics and Darkest Dungeon`**: Provides the AI with the key artistic references for isometric and mood.
-   **`fierce, Dog-like Brawler, muscular build, menacing posture`**: Describes the creature's role and personality.
-   **`dark chitinous carapace, eyeless head, massive jaw`**: Adds the physical details that make it alien and frightening.

*Note: For a functional game asset, this prompt should be used to generate sprites for multiple directions (e.g., facing Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest).*
